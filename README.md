# some browser game

this repo is the frontend. we should use another for the backend when that comes around.

feature checklist:

- [x] topdown game
- [x] 2d game
- [x] player character
- [ ] weapons/attacks?
- [ ] enemies?
- [ ] some kind of level design?
- [ ] dank shader / camera / etc effects
- [ ] HUD 
- [ ] main menu
- [ ] loading system (aka refactor the junk textureloads sprinkled about)
- [ ] multiplayer?
- [ ] chat? -- probably requires working on HUD first
