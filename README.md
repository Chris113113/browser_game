## feature checklist:

- [x] topdown game
- [x] 2d game
- [x] player character
- [x] weapons/attacks?
- [x] enemies?
- [x] some kind of level design?
- [ ] dank shader / camera / etc effects
- [/] HUD 
- [ ] main menu
- [x] loading system (aka refactor the junk textureloads sprinkled about)
- [ ] multiplayer?
- [x] chat? -- probably requires working on HUD first
